Create a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a piece of text belonging to a particular class, we can use techniques like Bag of Words, tf-idf vectorization, and word embedding.
In this project Include some csv files like:
train.csv,
test.csv,
sampleSubmission_small.csv,
trainLabels.csv
and the key points of the project is Data preprocessing using Hash fields, Feature extraction, Model Building ,Prediction.
I have done this project on jupyter notebook platform
